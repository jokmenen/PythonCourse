    "# Welcome to the final lecture: data visualization / Plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the last few weeks, we've taken a real deep dive into the world of Python. Some chapters were probably harder than others, but if you made it this far, you can congratulate yourself on being persistent in your learnings! Chapeau! \n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture consists of two sections. Plotting and a section on how to continue; which we will mostly discuss during the public lecture. In this notebook, we start with plotting. Plotting is a common way to make data understandable, as one picture says more than a thousand words. Today's lecture will introduce you to plotting in python with Matplotlib, which is arguably the most popular graphing and data visualization library for Python. Matplotlib stands for Mathematical Plotting Library, suggesting that it a useful tool for plotting numbers, which it is! \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides Matplotlib, there are many other libraries available to plot your data. Among them are Seaborn (based on Matplotlib, but slightly more sleek and thus a tip if you want to present your data), geoplot (for plotting location data), and Bokeh (making web-ready graphs). We will not discuss these other libraries, but I hope you understand that there are many other options available to plot data. If you google on plotting python examples, you'll meet some other libraries which you can use. Do not limit yourself to matplotlib. It is good to stay loyal, but a little bit of cheating on your plotting library won't hurt anybody ;)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to plot, we need to get our data in the right structure first. Hence, last week when we learned the ins and outs of pandas, we prepared data. This week, we will use some of the same data sources, prepare the data again (practice makes perfect), and then plot the data! \n",
    "\n",
    "However, as I said during the first lecture, these kinds of notebooks are very useful as they can be connected to dashboarding software, such as Tableau and PowerBI. So while possible to use Python for making graphics, you are free to do so in Tableau or PowerBI if you are already proficient with it. However, one big advantage of Python is that it is easy to automate the whole process of making plots. So if there is a plot that you have to make every week or month, and the data is always in the same format, definitively use Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11.0 Telling a story with data is complicated\n",
    "\n",
    "It is true that in this chapter, we will briefly discuss some possibilities of plotting data. Truth be told, visualising data in a clear way that also inspires your audience to commit to action is often quite a challenge. Not only because the possibilities are endless from a technical perspective, but also because you have to think of a story to tell with your visualisation that reaches your audience. However, it will all be worth it after the actions committed because of your visualisation lead to a great solution. Moral of the story: Investing time in good Data Visualisation is difficult but worth it!\n",
    "\n",
    "In school, we learn a lot about language and math. On the language side, we learn how to put words together into sentences and stories. With math, we learn to make sense of numbers. But these two sides are rarely paired: **no one teaches us how to tell stories with numbers**. This leaves us poorly prepared for an important task that is increasingly in demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, I argue that **success in data visualization does not start with data visualization**, which may seem counterintuitive. Rather, before you begin down the path of creating a data visualization or communication, attention and time should be paid to understanding the context for the need to communicate. Being able to visualize data and tell stories with it is key to turning it into information that can be used to drive better decision-making. Having the tools for making great visualisations of data, aids you in that process. So lets have a look at one of the Data Vis tools available in python!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11.1 Importing libraries\n",
    "As with almost advanced function of Python, we first need to import our Data Vis library: matplotlib. We've done this before with pandas. I always import both libraries at the start of every document. You end up using them a lot. Importing matplotlib is a bit weird, since you have to specify you want to use `matplotlib.pyplot` (no one really knows why, just a matplotlib quirk). Like mentioned before, often used libraries are often shortened so you have to type less in the code. We do this using  `as plt ` (short for plot). Now, for matplotlib, people often do an `inline` argument when working in jupyter. This only works when we're working in Jupyter notebooks and prevents our plots from becoming too big for our screen, as it will render the plots 'inline'. Using this command once is best practice and advised by almost everybody on the world wide web. Hence, I'm doing the same.  Again, this was all in the documentation; simply copy-paste. I suggest you do the same (using this notebook as a source, or the official documentation)."

    "Line graphs are used to track changes over short and long periods of time. Line graphs can also be used to compare changes over the same period of time for more than one group. We often see line charts to display our annual revenue and use second line to display last years revenue. They are usefull to quickly analyze our data for trends, peaks/spikes and valleys/downs. For example, when we would plot the revenue of our FOX and Reizen collegues, we would clearly see the Corona crisis as a downward trend. \n",

There is still a lot more that we can change using the `plt.` statement, but lets not go too deep. More detail are available on the Matplotlib website.

Cars with high mileage are worth less, and the most expensive cars in the data set are on the low end of th mileage. \n",
