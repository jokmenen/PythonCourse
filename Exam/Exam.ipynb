    "# Python Exam 2021\n",
    "Dear colleagues, welcome to the Python Exam of 2021.\n",
    "During the course, we learned a lot about Python. Time to put that knowledge to the test! The goal of this Exam is for you to find out what parts of Python you are already awesome at, and what parts still need some practice. How you make this exam is up to you: You are allowed to collaborate or to use google, but I do recommend trying to make it without external help first. Upon completion of the exam, you can send the Jupyter Notebook file to rpieternella@anwb.nl. In order to download the jupyter notebook file, go to File in the menu bar and click Download. Please put your name in the filename so I can identify it. "

    "## Question 1\n",
    "In the codeblock below, your colleague wrote some code to automatically transform names into email addresses. After speaking with your stakeholder, you decided that the functionality of this code needs to be changed up a bit. However, the colleague who wrote this code is unfortunately on holiday, so it's all up to you. Similarly unfortunate is that your colleague forgot to add any comments, and was not really clear with his variable names. Thus, your task right now is to decypher the code below and make the changes that the stakeholder wants. And, in order to prevent this from happening again: do your colleague a favour by adding comments and understandable variable names to the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Decypher the code to understand what it does. Then, change the function so all resulting email addresses have 'the_real_' in front of them like so:\n",
    "    'the_real_ramon_pieternella@anwb.nl'\n",
    "    \n",
    "b.  Add comments and replace the variable names with names that make the code more readable for other colleagues who see it for the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "BONUS:\n",
    "c.  IT just informed you that email addresses cannot have underscores in them. Add a function that automatically removes underscores from the email addresses. Hint: you can for-loop over a string ;)"
