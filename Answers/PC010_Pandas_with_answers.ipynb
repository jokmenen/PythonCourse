    "# Welcome to section 2 of this course \n",
    "Section two will focus more on the data part of python, whereas in the first sections we covered the foundation. When we work with data in Python, we can do so in many ways, such as using lists filled with integers, strings and many more. However, one of the most common and easy ways to work with data in Python is by using **DataFrames**. Dataframes are very similair to 2-Dimensional Excel tables (or SQL output for that matter) and are thus very recognizable and interpretable for us humans. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, by default, Python does not work with Dataframes out of the box. Fortunately, Python has many openly available additional libraries and modules. The one we're going to work with first is Pandas. Pandas is a python library designed to make many common types of data analysis straightforward and can be used to work with Dataframes, making it is incredibly useful for grouping data, aggregating and processing these groups, and reshaping data. Support for time-series analyses in Pandas is also strong with built-in date and time representations. Thus, long story short: Pandas is exactly what we need! Especially if we reconsider these monthly tasks that we used to do manually in Excel. Pandas to the rescue! Additionally, as Pandas is so commenly used, Google knows the answer to almost everything regarding pandas! \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, get yourself some cofee, because the real fun starts here!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we'll walk through the possibilities of Pandas using a car data set from an car action centre in Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA. P.S. Did you know that the state of Oklahoma sees the most tornados annually out of all US states? Also, it was the first state where a parking meter was installed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data is in a .csv file, which is one of the most common ways to transfer data. As we've seen before, we can open .csv's with Excel and opt to split the cells based on the comma. However, hopefully after today, you'll give it a go using Python pandas. "

    "Before we start doing anything, we have to make sure we import the correct libraries. Thus, we **import pandas** using exactly that statement. without important pandas, we'll get an error when we try to use it. If we use something from the library, we need to specifiy which library we're using. Thus, we start every specific pandas commando (code-line) with *pandas.*. We'll see in litle bit how this works out. Additionally, we need to know where our datafile is. In our case, we've put everything in the same folder, but we can go a level down in our folder structure if we wish to do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have pandas imported and know the location of our .csv datafile, we can start opening our data! We can do so using `'pandas.read_csv('document.csv')'` and assign it to a variable. If we assign it to variable, we still have to display our results, like we've seen with the print() statement. However, as displaying an entire dataframe with data can be quite cumbersome, there is an option to only show to the top or final section of the dataframe using `'.head()'` or `'.tail()'`. Let's see how this works.\n",

    "For example, if we want to divide our car price paid during the auction with the mileage of the car and add that in a new column, we can easily do so with pandas. With the powerfull square brackets in pandas, we simply create a new columnname. `'data['new_column']'` should do the trick. If we simply run this as a command, we will get a new empty column with the title new_column. Easy piezy. However, now we actually want that column to contain something. We can do so by treating it as a variable and storing content in it (just like we do with a variable). Thus, we can store formulas, text and even do data modalations. Let's see if we can divide our car price with the mileage and put that into a new column. I can assure, we can, and relatively easy as well! \n",

The action is performs, is called an aggregation.  In the example below, we do a describe, but it can many different functions, depending on what you want. Again, there is no need to study them all and learn them by hard.

    "#### Joins using the Join function\n",
    "\n",
    "Join is a convenience function in pandas for joining two dataframes. It is a wrapper around the merge function. Suppose we have two dataframes, containing data on consumers with their unique membershipnumber (or klantnummer, hence they start with a K) as unique variable. I just create two dataframes manually. This might come in handy later. So store this as your reference. However, for this course, I presume you will retrieve most data either from excel or databases. I deem the changes that you will actually build a dataframe from scratisch using python, at most minimal. \n",
    "\n",
    "On purpose, the left side, or the first dataframe containing demographic data has K0 to K2. However, the right side, or the dataframe container specific membership details for retail customers, does not contain K1, but does include K3. This is also something we often see in real life examples. Not every costumer is in every database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Joining data in pandas (and in many other languages for that matter) requires an overlapping column, so that we know where to stick which information. This is called a **shared key**. By default, pandas uses the index, which in our case is the 'Klantnummer'. \n",
    "\n",
    "I highly recommend you take 10 minutes to understand this topic further by reading https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/05-merging-data/. There is alot of on information on this topic, and it is vital to understand that there are multiple ways to join datasets, and most variants have different outcomes. I hope that the folloiwing examples make it slighly clear. But, once again, practise makes perfect."

However, most of the basic operations work perfectly with join, hence we won't dive to deep into merge (unless you want to go hardcore!*). Speaking abouting diving: joins use merges underwater.

It requires some practise to do all actions instantly and some google'ing to find all the inns-and-outs of pandas, but the functions are really intuitive and the sky is the limit. Personally, when I started working with Pandas I used the DataCamp pandas cheatsheet a lot, which can be found here: http://datacamp-community-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/dbed353d-2757-4617-8206-8767ab379ab3. This cheatsheet contains the basics (how to open a csv and excel file), but also comes in handy when you want to select data.
